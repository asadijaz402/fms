                    There are two distinct areas that fleet management covers,
                    the vehicles and the drivers. Fleet management software
                    (FMS) is generally used to collect data from a few key areas
                    while the vehicle is in service. That data is then analyzed
                    to reveal areas that need improvement so that adjustments
                    can be made in real-time. <br></br> <br></br>To help with
                    the fleet we have developed the following modules:

                  We started with understanding problems, issues, and gaps in an
                  existing fleet managing company. <br></br> <br></br> After
                  gathering requirements, we drafted a solution and technical
                  architecture. <br></br> <br></br> It helped us to deal with
                  multiple modules required to solve problems in multiple
                  domains, either the vehicle side or the driver side.

                  While developing each module we made sure, they are compatible
                  with each other. Should be easy to use and can be modified
                  based on customer requirements. <br></br> <br></br> We went
                  with cloud deployment giving it the ability to be accessed
                  from anywhere around the world. It can be used in a web
                  browser or as a stand-alone application.

                    Make fleet management software an essential tool for smooth
                    operations of the fleet, no matter the size. Tracking the
                    location and condition of the vehicles, maintenance
                    schedules, and fuel usage help manage costs and keeps the
                    equipment working longer.
